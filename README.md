# HP-EH1xxx-OCEFI
Opencore EFI for HP Pavillion 15 EH-1xxx  (AMD) 
Note : this was actually made for EH-1082AU model 

Tested on Seqouia and Tahoe beta 1 & 2

My Specs are : 
Ryzen 5 5500U 16GB RAM
AMD Intergrated Graphhics
NVme : WD PC SN530 (512GB)
Network Adapter : Realtek 8852AU (not working and disabled) 
Using Horndis for network instead (tethering)

For Audio without usb audio on tahoe beta 2 you need VoodooHDA 
Use Offline Installer for Macos to be installed. This laptop have whitelisted Network Adapter (the one with HP spare parts) so random network adapter wont work.
